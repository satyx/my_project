Actually by mistake I had re-downloaded all the lecture notes while preparing for mid-sem exams
that I had already downloaded before the class test preparation. So, I decided to delete them

But they were more than 20 files and hence I decided to let the script do it for me

Fortunately the filename had "DAA_LECTURE" (DAA stands for Design and Analysis of Algorithms) in common. So,it hardly
became a task of 1 min which earlier I had to find manually each file and then delete.

Laziness saves human effort. Should this abstract term also be considered as a "Machine" ;-P
